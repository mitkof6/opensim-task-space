Description
---

This folder contains the development of task space projection for OpenSim
v4.0. The purpose is to design well documented and useful API where the user can
plan a movement in task space and perform simulations in a mixed dynamics
manner. A mixed dynamics scheme is a combination of an inverse dynamics
controller (task space equations of motion) that feds a forward dynamics module.
